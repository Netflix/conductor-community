## FAQ
#### Why separate repository?
The number of contributions, especially newer implementations of the core contracts in Conductor has increased over the past few years. 
There is interest in the community to contribute more implementations. 
To streamline the support and release of the existing community-contributed implementations and future ones, we are creating a new repository dedicated to hosting just contributions. 
Conductor users who wish to use a contributed module will have a dedicated place to ask questions directly to fellow members of the community. 

Having a separate repository will allow us to scale the contributions and also ensure we are able to review and merge PRs in a timely fashion.

#### How often builds are published?
Similar to core Conductor the builds are published often with each major release.
Release numbers are kept in sync with main Conductor releases, which removes the need for a version compatibility matrix.

#### How do I get help?

#### How do I add new modules here?
1. Start with a proposal by posting on the discussion
2. Send a PR

#### I have a question not listed here.
Please use the Discussions on Conductor repo at https://github.com/Netflix/conductor/discussions

#### Does it change how I build Conductor or use the Conductor binaries? (Do I need to pull additional dependency in my builds going forward?)
Conductor (https://github.com/Netflix/conductor) **no longer** pulls in all the dependencies from this repository as part of the [conductor-server](https://github.com/Netflix/conductor/tree/main/server) build.
If you plan to use the modules from this repository, please build [community-server](/community-server) which pulls in all the dependencies.
